# Vietnam Tech Society (VTS)

Vietnam Tech Society (VTS) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in 2020 with a mission: to make mentorship accessible to all individuals in the tech industry. Our vision is to create a world where anyone, regardless of their background or resources, can find guidance and support to thrive in the tech industry.

## Our Platform

At the heart of our efforts is <a href="https://techsphere.app" target="_blank">techsphere.app</a>, an innovative online platform specifically designed for the Vietnamese community. This platform allows individuals to find, book, and meet professional mentors in the tech industry for free. Whether you are a student aspiring to enter the tech world, a professional looking to advance your career, or someone considering a career change into tech, techsphere.app provides the resources and connections you need to succeed.

## Our Impact

Since our inception, we have made significant strides in fulfilling our mission. Over the past three years, our platform has successfully connected 85 dedicated mentors with 650 eager mentees. This has resulted in over 2,050 mentorship calls, each one representing an opportunity for growth, learning, and professional development. Our mentors, who are experienced professionals from various tech fields, volunteer their time and expertise to help mentees navigate their career paths, develop new skills, and overcome challenges.

## Support Us
